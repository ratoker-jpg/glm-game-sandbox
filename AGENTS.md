# AGENTS.md - GLM Sandbox Rules

This repository is a GLM sandbox copy of the browser RTS project. It is not the production project and must be treated as an isolated test repository.

Sandbox path:

```text
C:\Users\Den\Desktop\GLM_test\glm_game_sandbox
```

Production path that must not be touched:

```text
C:\Users\Den\Desktop\four elements\four_elements_core_base
```

Core rules:

1. Do not push directly to `main`.
2. Work only in feature branches created from `sandbox/main`.
3. Keep diffs minimal and reversible.
4. Do not rewrite architecture unless explicitly requested.
5. Do not modify gameplay code unless the task explicitly requires it.
6. Do not modify assets unless explicitly requested.
7. Do not sync anything to `FourElements_WORK_MIRROR`.
8. Do not run Google Drive sync helpers from this sandbox.
9. Do not touch the production folder.
10. If the task is ambiguous, stop and ask before changing files.

Working expectations:

1. Prefer infrastructure, tooling, docs, and guardrail changes over broad refactors.
2. Avoid touching `src/main.js` unless the task explicitly requires it.
3. If `src/main.js` must be touched, explain why first and keep the edit as small as possible.
4. Always create or update `PATCH_REPORT.txt` after changes.
5. Always list changed files and checks that were run.
6. Prefer reversible renames, guards, or isolated config updates over deletions.

Git and review workflow:

1. Use `sandbox/main` as the protected sandbox baseline branch.
2. Create feature branches for all follow-up work.
3. Review staged changes before commit.
4. Never treat this sandbox as the source of truth for the production project.

GitHub-first workflow:

1. The **GitHub branch `sandbox/main`** is the source of truth for the GLM sandbox.
2. All GLM work flows through GitHub PRs — not through the local folder.
3. The local folder is a **disposable snapshot**, not the authoritative copy.
4. The local folder does **not** need to be updated after every PR. It is only needed for Codex, manual local tests, copying to production, or building a fresh snapshot.
5. Before Codex: download ZIP from `sandbox/main` on GitHub, delete the old local folder, unpack the ZIP fresh. Never unpack on top of an existing folder.
